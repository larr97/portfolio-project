# Week 5 Progress Journal  

## Overview  
In Week 5, the focus shifted toward polishing professional assets and advancing system documentation. A professional headshot was taken and integrated into the portfolio to enhance personal branding. Key deliverables such as a resume and a reusable cover letter template tailored for software engineer roles were created. From a technical standpoint, version 1 of the System Design Document (SDD) was completed, and version 2 of the Requirement Analysis Document (RAD) was finalized based on insights from the system design phase. Visual design continued to evolve with the integration of 3D mockups and the use of advanced Figma plugins, improving the presentation and realism of the prototype across Apple devices.

## Completed Tasks 
- Took a professional headshot and added it to the portfolio.
- Developed a professional Resume.
- Drafted a reusable Cover Letter Template for Software Engineer positions.
- Completed *version 1* of the **System Design Document (SDD)**.
- Finalized *version 2* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** with updates reflecting feedback from the system design phase.

## Challenges 
- Structuring the System Design Document required clear thinking about system components and interactions, particularly when translating abstract ideas into technical specifications.

## Lessons Learned
- Used the following Figma 3D mockup files to showcase the prototype across Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac) and enhance visual depth:
  - [iPhone 15 Pro 3D Mockups](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1303247171848616022)
  - [iPhone 16 3D Mockups](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1418536344551947357)
  - [iPad Mini 3D Mockup](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1045371607869048524)
  - [iPad Air 3D Mockup](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1005124700403013609)
  - [MacBook Pro 16 3D Mockups](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1162016271988369755)
  - [MacBook Pro 3D Mockups](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1176558805861554548)
- I learned how to used the [Figma Mockup plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/817043359134136295/mockup-plugin-devices-mockups-print-mockups-ai-mockups) that provides a high-quality mockup library along with perspective and warp transformation tools for creating realistic, customizable visual presentations. Also I learned how to use it to apply images to the 3D Mockups.

## Next Steps 
- Start the **Object Design** phase of the project.
