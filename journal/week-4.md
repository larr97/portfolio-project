# Week 4 Progress Journal  

## Overview 
In Week 4, significant progress was made in both the design and documentation of the project. The Figma design and interactive prototype were completed, providing a clear, high-fidelity preview of the user interface across different devices. Additionally, *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** was finalized, outlining the core requirements and expectations for the system. During this week, a focus was placed on refining the user interface to ensure that it is both functional and visually consistent across desktop and mobile devices. Challenges around maintaining this consistency across varying screen sizes were addressed, setting a solid foundation for the next phase of the project: **System Design**.

## Completed Tasks  
- Finished Figma design and interactive prototype.
- Completed *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**.

## Challenges 
- Creating a concise and cohesive design for both desktop and mobile views while maintaining usability and visual consistency required careful adjustments. It was a detailed process to ensure that components looked and functioned the same, even as the design adapted to different screen sizes

## Lessons Learned
- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) was used to create UML diagrams for the Requirement Analysis Document (RAD) due to its built-in UML shape library and free availability.
- Explored the [type scale](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/type-scale-tokens) in Material Design, understanding its purpose, application, and role in creating a cohesive visual hierarchy.  
- Learned that type styles are defined by five key roles—**Display, Headline, Title, Body, and Label**—each serving a distinct function in UI design.  
- Used the [Material Theme Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder) to generate and apply a type scale, ensuring consistency across UI components.   
- Gained insights into **font size units, letter spacing units, and axes**, understanding how they influence typography across different screen sizes and contexts.  
- Studied the [applicability of types, roles, and type settings](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/applying-type), ensuring that typography aligns with design intent and usability principles.  
  - **Buttons** use the **Label Large** style for clear and readable action prompts.  
  - **Hyperlinked text** appearing on top of a surface color adopts the **Primary** color to maintain contrast and visibility.
- Additionally, explored **UI kits for Figma** for Angular Material, such as: [Angular Material Kit 1](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1292454516527463513) and [Angular Material Kit 2](https://www.figma.com/community/file/967106164617088179)
- Used the following Figma mockup files to showcase the prototype across Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac):
  - [Apple Frames](https://www.figma.com/design/BGYSaAC8z4jMO6LNnBa9aF/Apple-Frames--Community-?t=mUPiYffmSJ7nw5vC-0)

## Next Steps  
- Start the **System Design** phase of the project.
