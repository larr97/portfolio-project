# Week 3 Progress Journal  

## Overview  
In Week 3, I learned how to apply the color scheme created with the Material Theme Builder in Figma to Angular Material components. I also designed the Home Page and navigation bar and made progress on *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**.

## Completed Tasks  
- Learned how to apply the color scheme created with the Material Theme Builder in Figma to Angular Material components.
- Designed the Home Page and the navigation bar in Figma.
- Learned how to use typography from the Material Design guidelines.

## Challenges  
- As I am not primarily a designer, creating the design was challenging. To overcome this, I drew inspiration from existing designs and adapted them to fit the project requirements.

## Lessons Learned
- Explored how to translate Material Design Color Themes from Figma to Angular Material using the [Angular Material Theming Guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) and the [Material 3 Custom Theme schematic](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/material/schematics/ng-generate/theme-color/README.md) tool.  
- Customized Material Design Kit components with custom palette variables generated by the [Material Theme Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder), applying roles as suggested by Material Design.  
- Adopted [typography](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview) principles from the Material Design guidelines, selecting **Roboto** as the primary font and **DM Mono** for the logo.  

## Next Steps  
- Complete *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**.
- Finish the website design in Figma.
