# Week 1 Progress Journal

## Overview
In Week 1, I focused on setting up the foundation for my personal software development portfolio. This involved creating a GitHub repository for the portfolio, as well as establishing a folder structure to organize the project and documentation. 
I will be following the guidelines and methodology described in [*Object-Oriented Software Engineering: Using UML, Patterns, and Java™ (3rd Edition)*](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/object-oriented-software-engineering-using-uml-patterns-and-java/P200000003319/9780136061250) by Bruegge and Dutoit (2009) as the primary reference for software engineering principles, UML modeling, and design processes throughout this project.
As part of the **Requirement Elicitation** phase of the project, I started creating the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**. I also began exploring Figma for designing the website.

## Completed Tasks
- Created the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio.
- Set up a `journal/` folder in the repository to store progress journals.
- Completed *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** document for the portfolio, from introduction to the use case model.

## Challenges
- I have no experience with Figma, so I will need to learn how to use it.

## Lessons Learned
- One of the things I learned was that there are several programs for design, including [Figma](https://help.figma.com) and [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). These tools cater to different needs and preferences, and understanding their differences can help in choosing the right one for specific projects.
- Figma and Sketch are both powerful design tools, but they cater to different needs. Figma stands out for its cross-platform compatibility and real-time collaboration, making it ideal for teams working across devices and locations. In contrast, Sketch, with its macOS-exclusive design, offers faster performance and a robust plugin ecosystem that caters to users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.
- After comparing the two, I decided to use Figma for my project. Its accessibility, real-time collaboration features, and free tier make it a practical choice for learning and designing responsive layouts for my portfolio.
- I also learned the importance of following established software engineering methodologies to ensure a structured and effective design process. For this reason, I am aligning my work with the approach and best practices outlined by Bruegge and Dutoit (2009) in [*Object-Oriented Software Engineering: Using UML, Patterns, and Java™ (3rd Edition)*](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/object-oriented-software-engineering-using-uml-patterns-and-java/P200000003319/9780136061250).

## Next Steps
- Complete *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** for the portfolio, covering the object model, dynamic model, and user interface (navigational paths and screen mock-ups).
- Work on creating the website design on Figma.
