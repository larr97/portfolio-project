# Week 1 Progress Journal

## Overview
In Week 1, I focused on setting up the foundation for my personal software development portfolio. This involved creating a GitHub repository for the portfolio, as well as establishing a folder structure to organize the project and documentation. As part of the **Requirement Elicitation** phase of the project, I started creating the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**. I also began exploring Figma for designing the website.

## Completed Tasks
- Created the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio.
- Set up a `journal/` folder in the repository to store progress journals.
- Completed *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** document for the portfolio, from introduction to the use case model.

## Challenges
- I have no experience with Figma, so I will need to learn how to use it.

## Next Steps
- Complete *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** for the portfolio, covering the object model, dynamic model, and user interface (navigational paths and screen mock-ups).
- Work on creating the website layout on Figma.
