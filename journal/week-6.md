# Week 6 Progress Journal  

## Overview  
This week, I focused on finalizing key software engineering documentation and preparing for the implementation phase of my web portfolio project. I revised earlier deliverables based on feedback and introduced automated documentation practices to streamline object design maintenance.

## Completed Tasks  
- Finalized *version 3* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)** with updates reflecting feedback from the object design phase.  
- Completed *version 2* of the **System Design Document (SDD)** incorporating feedback from the object design phase.  
- Completed *version 1* of the **Object Design Document (ODD)**, although the interface specification is maintained automatically using **Compodoc**.

## Challenges  
One of the main challenges this week was maintaining consistency among the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**, **System Design Document (SDD)**, and **Object Design Document (ODD)**, especially regarding naming conventions and design alignment. Since implementation in Angular has not yet begun, it was important to establish clear and consistent naming standards and detailed documentation to ensure a smooth transition when development starts.

## Lessons Learned  
- I learned about the **Object Constraint Language (OCL)** and its role in specifying constraints on UML models.  
- The chosen approach for the **Object Design Document (ODD)** is **ODD embedded into source code**, following the method described by Bruegge and Dutoit in [*Object-Oriented Software Engineering: Using UML, Patterns, and Javaâ„¢ (3rd Edition)*](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/object-oriented-software-engineering-using-uml-patterns-and-java/P200000003319/9780136061250). This involves documenting object design directly within source code using tagged comments on classes and interfaces.  
- TypeScript source code is annotated with **[JSDoc-style](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) tagged comments** on classes and interfaces to capture design details.  
- Tools like **[Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/)** automatically extract these comments to generate up-to-date, human-readable documentation.  
- To prevent duplication and maintain consistency, the `ODD.md` file in the project repository contains direct links to the autogenerated Compodoc documentation, ensuring readers access the most current object design documentation without manual markdown updates.

## Next Steps  
- Begin the implementation phase by translating the Object Design Document (ODD) into Angular components and services. Simultaneously, convert the Figma design into Angular HTML templates and CSS styles.
