# Week 2 Progress Journal  

## Overview  
In Week 2, I concentrated on learning and familiarizing myself with Figma as part of the User Interface design phase. This involved understanding the basics and how to translate designs into CSS, utilizing Figma's auto layout for responsive design, and incorporating accessibility components to ensure inclusivity. Additionally, I explored how to work with variables and styles, as well as how to prepare variables for implementing light and dark themes effectively. Lastly, I learned prototyping, which helped me visualize interactive designs and workflows.
I also began designing the User Interface in Figma and explored **Material Design** as a guiding framework for designing my portfolio. During this process, I learned how the color system works, color roles, and color schemas, and how to apply custome color schemas to Figma's Design. 

## Completed Tasks  
- Learned the basics of Figma, including creating designs, translating them into CSS, using Figmaâ€™s auto layout features for responsive design, incorporating accessibility components,  working with variables and styles, and prototyping. 
- Learned the basics of Material Design 3, including how the color system works, color roles, color schemas, and utilizing its guidelines to design functional and user-friendly interfaces.  

## Challenges  
- There was a lot to learn about Figma and Material Design. Balancing the learning process for both while continuing to make progress on other aspects of the project was challenging.

## Lessons Learned
- I explored [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) as guidelines for my portfolio's design. Material Design 3 introduces more flexibility and personalization, emphasizing user-defined themes and modern aesthetics, supported by tools like the [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder).
- Additionally, UI kits for Figma, such as the [Material 3 Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460), [Build a Material color scheme (Community)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1248805263844976008), and plugins like [Material Theme Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/material-theme-builder) provide ready-to-use components that simplify the design process and help maintain consistency, while working with Figma.
- I learned the guidelines on how to create a [custom static color scheme](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/static/custom-brand) with Material Design and use it in Figma's Design.
- I'm planning to use Angular as the frontend framework, [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is a UI component library specifically built for Angular, and it follows the guidelines of Material Design.
- I also explored plugins like [Contrast](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/contrast), which checks the color contrast ratios against **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** to ensure accessibility, and [Color Blind](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733343906244951586/color-blind), which simulates how designs appear to individuals with different types of color blindness by creating altered versions of a selection. These plugins are valuable tools for making sure my design is accessible to a wider audience.
- In summary, I learned the fundamentals of **Material Design 3**, including how the color system works, color roles, and color schemas, and how to apply custome color schemas to Figma's Design. 

## Next Steps  
- As part of the **Analysis** phase of the project, completed *version 1* of the **Requirement Analysis Document (RAD)**, covering the Object model, Dynamic model, and User Interface (navigational paths and screen mock-ups).  
- Continue working on creating the website design in Figma.
- I need to learn how to apply the created color scheme with the Material Theme Builder in Figma to the Angular Material Components.
