##### 1.6 Overview

This document outlines the initial requirements for developing a Web Developer Portfolio. Subsequent sections will include system design, implementation details, and testing plans. This document aims to ensure a clear understanding of the project’s goals and deliverables among stakeholders, ensuring a successful development process.
